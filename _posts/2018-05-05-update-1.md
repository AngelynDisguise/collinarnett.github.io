Today I updated my [my-resources](https://github.com/collinarnett/my-resources) project with a few websites that I use on a regular basis to either help me be more productive or help me learn. I plan to update this project weekly with information that keeps me interested in the subject of computer science. I enjoy computer science as my passion although I find it easy to lull into a routine of eat, sleep, Reddit, repeat and I don't like that. I feel like I have the potential to be learning more in my spare time and I don't think I'm working hard enough to meet my own expectations.

I hope in my pursuit of knowledge throughout the week I can make enough headway in gathering useful information for my-resources and thus pass on that information to anyone reading. I think that the key to any successful project lies in helping others as much as helping your self, so when I'm learning about something new I can pass it on to others.

So to anyone reading out there, enjoy the links and share with a friend if you think it will help them.
