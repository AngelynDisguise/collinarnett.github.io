==Creating a mobile-nixos Installer==

===Motivation===

Currently mobile-nixos has no non-nix friendly installation
method. The current method involves many annoying imperative steps that do not
follow nix best practices. Eg. To install mobile-nixos the setup process has the
following steps:

1. `git clone` the mobile-nixos repository.
2. Find the latest revision of mobile-nixos that successfully builds on hydra.
3. `git clone` nixpkgs and checkout the target revision.
4. Change NIXPATH to the local nixpkgs repository.
5. Create a `local.nix` to apply configuration options to the image being built.
6. Use `nix-build` to compile mobile-nixos.

These steps imply users have knowledge of nixpkgs, nix-build and how nix
expressions work for importing `local.nix`. To remove this barrier to the nix
ecosystem, mobile-nixos requires an installer similar to the
[[https://nixos.org/blog/announcements.html|the one on desktop NixOS]]. Adding an installer to mobile-nixos gives users the
ability to trial NixOS and the Nix ecosystem when they might have passed over
the desktop distribution.

===Introduction to Calamares===

Creating an installer for  would require the use of the installer framework
[[https://github.com/calamares/calamares|Calamares]], the same framework used
for desktop NixOS.

Calamares would solve the problem of introducing new users mobile-nixos since
provides an intuitive GUI to step users through the different configuration
options when installing mobile-nixos. [[https://postmarketos.org/|postmarketOS]] has already implemented
a

Calamares extension]] which allows postmarket to capture
