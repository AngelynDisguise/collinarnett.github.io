==Creating a mobile-nixos Installer==

===Motivation===

Currently mobile-nixos has no non-nix friendly installation method. The current
method involves many annoying imperative steps that do not follow nix best
practices. Eg. To install mobile-nixos the setup process has the following
steps:

1. `git clone` the mobile-nixos repository.
2. Find the latest revision of mobile-nixos that successfully builds on hydra.
3. `git clone` nixpkgs and checkout the target revision.
4. Change `NIXPATH` to the local nixpkgs repository.
5. Create a `local.nix` to apply configuration options to the image being built.
6. Use `nix-build` to compile mobile-nixos.

These steps imply users have knowledge of nixpkgs, nix-build and how nix
expressions work for importing `local.nix`. To remove this barrier to the nix
ecosystem, mobile-nixos requires an installer similar to the
[[https://nixos.org/blog/announcements.html|the one on desktop NixOS]]. Adding
an installer to mobile-nixos gives users the ability to trial NixOS and the Nix
ecosystem when they might have passed over the desktop distribution.

===Introduction to Calamares===

Creating an installer for mobile-nixos would require the use of the installer
framework [[https://github.com/calamares/calamares|Calamares]], the same
framework used for desktop NixOS.

Calamares solves the problem of introducing new users mobile-nixos since
provides an intuitive GUI to step users through the different configuration
options when installing mobile-nixos. [[https://postmarketos.org/|postmarketOS]]
has already implemented a
[[https://github.com/calamares/calamares-extensions/blob/calamares/modules/mobile/CMakeLists.txt|mobile Calamares extension]] which allows postmarketOS to capture users looking to use
mobile friendly Linux distributions without a large barrier to entry.

Calamares allows developers to define and customize the following setup steps:

1. Welcome
2. Location
3. Keyboard
4. Partitions
5. Users
6. Summary
7. Install
8. Flash

===Calamares Internals & NixOS===

Calamares defines three different consumers of Calamares:

1. Developer - Those who work on Calamares itself.
2. Deployer - Those who use Calamares to deploy their Linux distribution.
3. User - Those who use Calamares to install a given Linux distribution.

Deployer's must create Calamares *modules* to deploy their distribution. In the
case of NixOS, modules are packaged in a Calamares *extension* which is then
included in the NixOS installer image.

From a deployer's perspective, Calamares uses two methods of customizing the
installer experience for the end user:

1. `viewmodule` - User visible modules. C++, Widgets, QML.
2. `jobmodule` - Non-user visible modules. C++, Python, external process (not
	 recommended).

====Python Job Module====

NixOS' Calamares extension includes a python job which is responsible for
creating a new nix configuration file which contains sections of nix code which
correspond with the user's choices when moving through the Calamares setup
process. For example:

In the
[[https://github.com/NixOS/calamares-nixos-extensions/blob/calamares/modules/nixos/main.py|main.py]]
file there is a string block corresponding to gnome being enabled:
{{{python
cfggnome = """  # Enable the X11 windowing system.
  services.xserver.enable = true;
  # Enable the GNOME Desktop Environment.
  services.xserver.displayManager.gdm.enable = true;
  services.xserver.desktopManager.gnome.enable = true;
"""
}}}
which is eventually enabled with the following logic:
{{{python
if gs.value("packagechooser_packagechooser") == "gnome":
		cfg += cfggnome
}}}

More information about Calamares python jobs can be found in the
[[https://github.com/calamares/calamares/blob/calamares/src/modules/README.md#python-modules|Python Modules]] section of the documentation.

====QML View Module====

The NixOS Calamares extension uses QML for the customization of it's
`viewmodule` which handles the user interface and NixOS specific branding. In
addition to the python module and the view module, the extension also includes
the use of the following base Calamares modules:

* locale
* keyboard
* users
* partition
* packagechooser
