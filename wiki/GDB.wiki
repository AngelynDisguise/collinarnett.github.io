= GDB Cheatsheet =

== Starting ==

To get started, compile with the `g` flag to get debugging information in the
resulting binary.

{{{shell
gcc -g -o main main.c library.c header.h
}}}

Then use `gdb` to enter the interpreter.

{{{shell
gdb ./main
}}}

== TUI Mode ==

Once in the GDB interpreter run the following:

{{{shell
layout src
}}}

== Common Commands ==

- `run`: Runs the program in it's entirety. Also accepts arguments that would
	normally be passed in the command line.
- `b`: Sets a breakpoint at the given function.
- `s`: Steps to the next line.
- `n`: Run until the current function finishes.
