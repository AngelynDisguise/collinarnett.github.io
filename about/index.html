  I'm currently enrolled at <a href="https://www.nvcc.edu/">Northern Virginia Community College</a> as a Computer Science undergraduate. I hope to graduate by 2020 (or sooner) to continue my studies at <a href="https://www2.gmu.edu/">George Mason University</a>    and complete my PhD. My degree will be a stepping stone to furthering my passion for Machine Learning and A.I technologies. This blog is dedicated to tracking my progress with personal projects and my life in general. I hope that anyone visiting my site can learn something from visiting. Check my blog everyday for something new.
