Since I will be detailing my notes on these challenges though this blog, I
thought it would be a good idea to record how I deal with tooling and issues
faced during development.

For the answer for challenge 1 see the <a href="Introduction.html#Challenges">Challenges</a>
section of the Introduction.

		whatever makefiles or IDE projects you need to get it working.

If you have read any of my other articles or know me personally, you'll know
that I am obsessed with <a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a>. Therefore it's obvious that
I'll be wrapping all the code developed during reading this book with Nix. Since
the first coding challenge relies on Java I first need to learn how to package a
Java application with Nix since I've never worked with Nix and Java.
</p>

<p>
Lets start with a simple flake template:
</p>

<pre nix>
{
  description =
    "Implementation of challenges proposed by the book Crafting Interpreters";
  inputs = {
    flake-utils.url = "github:numtide/flake-utils";
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs";
  };
  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, flake-utils }:
    flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem (system:
      let pkgs = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.${system};
      in with pkgs; rec {
        packages = flake-utils.lib.flattenTree {
					# Here is where we will package our first challenge
          HelloWorld = stdenv.mkDerivation { };
        };
        apps = {
          HelloWorld = flake-utils.lib.mkApp { drv = packages.java; };
        };
      });
}
</pre>

<p>
This template includes some helpful functions from the
<a href="https://github,com/numtide/flake-utils">flake-utils</a> set which make our
interactions with Nix flakes so much simpler. If you want to learn more about
flakes and how they work checkout Tweag's
<a href="https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-05-25-flakes/">blog post</a> for a simple
introduction on the subject.
