<p>
This book is positioned as a learn by doing book. The author explains that this
foray is aimed less at theory and more at understanding from the perspective of
playing around to the extent that the reader would fit in at a "cocktail party
for programming language researchers".
</p>

<p>
The language being implemented is called Lox and readers will be implementing it

<p>
The author describes the motivation less as a motivation in learning how to make
an exquisite general purpose language but understanding the motivations of
<span id="Chapter 1: Introduction-1.1.1 Little Languages-little languages"></span><strong id="little languages">little languages</strong> (Make, YAML and JSON just to name a few I'm familiar with).
This should help readers who might need to create a custom parser or tool that
might not exist.

<div id="Chapter 1: Introduction-1.1.1 Little Languages-Side Tangent"><h4 id="Side Tangent" class="header"><a href="#Chapter 1: Introduction-1.1.1 Little Languages-Side Tangent">Side Tangent</a></h4></div>

<p>
The reason I'm reading this book is to gain insight into thoughtful API design.
I'm not very good at writing large programs since I struggle with scaling my
applications beyond simple scripts. I'm hoping this book will teach me more
about the underlying structure of programming languages such that I can
intuitively understand where I'm supposed to be going when writing my
applications.

<p>
The author comments on how implementing a language is a monumental task, that
once accomplished makes other programming endeavors much easier. Easier since
you become so familiar with optimization on the memory and runtime side of
things (data structures and algorithms play a big hand in this obviously).
</p>

<div id="Chapter 1: Introduction-1.2 How the book is Organized"><h2 id="1.2 How the book is Organized" class="header"><a href="#Chapter 1: Introduction-1.2 How the book is Organized">1.2 How the book is Organized</a></h2></div>

<p>
The book is organized into 3 parts:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Introduction

<li>
Building a Lox Interpreter

<li>
Building a Lox Interpreter

</ol>

<p>
The author hasn't detailed anything beyond this so we'll see where to go from
here.
</p>

<div id="Chapter 1: Introduction-1.2 How the book is Organized-1.2.1 The code"><h3 id="1.2.1 The code" class="header"><a href="#Chapter 1: Introduction-1.2 How the book is Organized-1.2.1 The code">1.2.1 The code</a></h3></div>

<p>
Apparently in other books focused on this same topic they choose to what the
author refers to as <span id="Chapter 1: Introduction-1.2 How the book is Organized-1.2.1 The code-compiler-compilers"></span><strong id="compiler-compilers">compiler-compilers</strong> that generate code from some higher
level description (I'm guessing this is similar to low or no code examples) but
assures the readers that he will abstain from using these to keep us as close to
the real thing as possible.
</p>

<p>
He also explains that this book will not help with setting up the environment
associated with any of the programming. For this reason I will be using Nix as
always to follow along with this book and document my experience moving forward.
The majority of section 1.2 discusses how the book is formatted but there is a
small snippet of a section where he explains that at the end of some chapters
there will be a design section (I'm very excited for these)
</p>

<div id="Chapter 1: Introduction-1.3 The First Interpreter"><h2 id="1.3 The First Interpreter" class="header"><a href="#Chapter 1: Introduction-1.3 The First Interpreter">1.3 The First Interpreter</a></h2></div>

<p>
This section explains the author's choice for using Java as the language to
implement the first interpreter. He explains how the static typing and structure
that Java gives helps write cleaner code leading to a better understanding of
the language creation process. Java is also a popular object oriented language
therefore allowing most readers to interact with this section easily.
</p>

<div id="Chapter 1: Introduction-1.4 The Second interpreter"><h2 id="1.4 The Second interpreter" class="header"><a href="#Chapter 1: Introduction-1.4 The Second interpreter">1.4 The Second interpreter</a></h2></div>

<p>
As with the last section this one also deals with the language associated with
the second interpreter. This time the language chosen is C. C is an obvious
choice to implement a language in since it boasts fast performance and fantastic
portability. He also details how the first interpreter is focused on being
correct while the second one is focused on speed and efficiency. Of course the
author will also have us test the implementation of this language, benchmarking
it against others.
